## Model Building
First, I split the data into train/test set with a 80/20 split.Next, I trained a logisitic regression and decision tree models using the caret and rpart packages.
## Model Performance
The accuracy of the logistic regression and decision tree models are fairly similar, but the logisitic regression is a bit better.
### Logistic Regression:
- Accuracy: 81.62%
- AUC: 86.37%

### Decision Tree
â€¢	Accuracy: 79.85%
